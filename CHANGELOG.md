# 0.6.0
* universal open/save:
Clients that announce support for global open/save via bchunk-hints
now trigger the file browser accordingly.

* display/share and target/share reworked:
Display/region/ based sharing removed (except for snapshot/monitor)
in favoring of a /target/share menu that consolidate all such options.

* uiprim/sbar:
statusbar custom button controls added, it is now possible to define
alt-action (such as custom popup spawn) as well as drag-action.

* workspace buttons now popup layout mode selector on altclick, and
migrate window on drag-drop

* uiprim/tbar:
titlebar merge-to-status bar mode on select (if hidden)
titlebar rclick now mappable (default, popup /target)

* uiprim/popup:
added basic popup component

* target-launch:
When activating global/target/launch to start a trusted application you
can also supply an application tag. This helps automation as you can now
specify that tag as part of /windows/by-tag etc. when there are no UUIDs
or other values to take advantage of.

* input/rotary added:
This tool implements basic gestures, commands and mapping for rotary devices
like the 'Surface Dial' and 'Griffin PowerMate'.

* tools/extbtn added:
Registers into global/settings/statusbar and adds option for external clients
to connect and attach custom buttons. This deprecates the statusbar IPC in
favor of solving this externally.

* tools/autostart added:
This tool allows a series of paths to be automatically run on startup.

* tools/profile\_picker added:
This tool is the first step towards better initial configuration. It triggers
on startup and installs UI schemas for default inputs, colors and security
profiles.

* triggers:
added per-window option to bind multiple custom triggers on select,
deselect and destroy

* layout/tile:
allow titlebar drag/drop as a mouse- triggered way to swap, m1 and m2 control
swap, join as child or join as sibling. allow better gap controls.

* layout/htab:
added side column based tabbed layout mode

* menu/hud:
Cipharius added support for fuzzy-string matching to the HUD, switch it on by
entering % and pick fuzzy_relevance as the sort method.

* menu/devmaps:
Custom menus/aliasmaps can now be built. These register in the menu root
(/menus) and are intended for shortcut button grids, popup menus, radial menus
and so on.

* workspaces assignment:
It is now possible to control which workspace new windows currently spawn at,
see the /global/settings/workspaces/spawn path.

* visual:
Add soft shadow controls to windows, ui elements and statusbar

* input/touch improvements:
New gestures, 'tap', 'doubletap', 'idle\_return', 'idle\_enter'. improved
relative mouse emulation to better handle click-select refactored some of the
code to more easilly accomodate custom classifiers. Some device profile based
values can now be changed through the path /global/input/touch.

* first round of (non-text) icon management (caching, shared sets etc.) added

* new tool: streamdeck
This allows external mini displays (touchbars etc.) to be hooked up and
act as restricted input devices as well as custom widget mappings

* new tool: todo
This tool allows for simple tracking of todo tasks that integrate with
the notification system, status bars and so on.

Minor / Fixes:
* added controls to insert subwindows as new windows or relative to their
  parents, (global/settings/workspaces/tiled/subwindow=normal,child)

* removed the 'alternate' window feature (used with wayland toplevels and
  terminal groups), the feature turned out way to complex and demanding in
	the way it was implemented.

* added 'invert light' shader that retains most of hue while inverting
  dark/light colors

* handover subsegment allocation now routes correctly

* silent shutdown retains known window position and states, should
  recover properly when started back up.

* region selection closure management reworked

* /bindtarget=/some/path sets a 'consume on use' path that allows interactive
  menu paths like key and button bindings to be automated

* target/window/move\_fx/fy added for display- size relative move

* firstrun.lua added to setup custom defaults on first run/config reset

* added color picker widget

* dropped the vr-viewer tool in favor of an upcoming way of allowing lwa
  clients that use the vr-subsystem so that safespaces can be used nested
	at minimal cost.

* display backlight controls changed into a submenu, added options for
  stepping

# 0.5.0
  * tools/advfloat:
     window-to-background will now receive input when no window is
     selected.

  * tools/advfloat:
     autolayout now recurses when one pass didn't position all windows
     autolayout also got a hide/reveal mode

     3D desktop-within-the-desktop.

  * distr/durden:
     launcher- script for reasonable defaults for linux/BSDs with
     arcan on egl-dri (native) platform.

  * decorations:
     added controls to hide dynamic workspace buttons
     added per-window controls to override titlebar pattern
     added per-window controls to modify titlebar buttons
		 added paths for border/titlebar primary colors

  * cursortagging:
     added (target/window/cursortag) as an option, experimental

  * mass-actions:
	   the root node /windows can now be used to address collections of
		 windows based on some property, such as name or type

Breaking:
  * statusbar visual config area changed to [px] from % point and
    order changed to [t l r d] to match other similar functions

  * target titlebar controls moved to its own group

	* border settings moved to its own group (/global/settings/border)

  * control channel (ipc pipes) have switched to using a domain
    socket for both input and output

  * entire menu/browser system refactored to have a more shared codebase,
    this moves all paths to be explicit /global/path/to /target/path/to
    /browse/shared/

  * multiple menu functions moved around and regrouped, all toggle
    options have been merged into the YES/NO paths that have been
    extended with YES/NO/FLIP

		use /global/input/mouse/coalesce=false

Minor / Fixes:

    tile mode as children of the selected window

  * added global/config/commit to make sure the current setings get
	  saved immediately

	* mouse/keyboard scripts are now switched to use the distribution
	  default from arcan

  * more terminal controls exposed: blinkrate, cursor style

  * added controls for border color

    client, which may prompt a client to jump to a different
    connection point or display server instance.

    some initial effects (gaussian blur, CRT-lottes).

  * tools/advfloat - extended float layout mode capabilities:

    subsegments. This match the new support in afsrv_terminal that
    allows the window to be cloned into a copy-window.

    patterns (%%) and sort-order modification (typing % lists options).

  * retain some window and workspace properties across script errors
    crashes and resets

  * menu navigation can now shows a helper description of the
    currently selected item

  * mode-sensitive titlebar icons - window titlebar icons can now be
    set to be activated only in certain modes

Minor:
 * Destroying a window in fullscreen mode now returns the workspace
   to the last known mode instead of forcing to tile.
